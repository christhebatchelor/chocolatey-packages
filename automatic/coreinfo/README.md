Coreinfo is a command-line utility that shows you the mapping between logical processors and the physical processor,
NUMA node, and socket on which they reside, as well as the cache’s assigned to each logical processor. It uses the
Windows’ [GetLogicalProcessorInformation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getlogicalprocessorinformation)
function to obtain this information and prints it to the screen, representing a mapping to a logical processor with an
asterisk e.g. ‘*’. Coreinfo is useful for gaining insight into the processor and cache topology of your system.

Usage: `coreinfo [-c][-f][-g][-l][-n][-s][-m][-v]`

Parameter | Description
:--------:|------------
-c        | Dump information on cores.
-f        | Dump core feature information.
-g        | Dump information on groups.
-l        | Dump information on caches.
-n        | Dump information on NUMA nodes.
-s        | Dump information on sockets.
-m        | Dump NUMA access cost.
-v        | Dump only virtualization-related features including support for second level address translation.
