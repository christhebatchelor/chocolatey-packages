## Virus Scan Results

There are a number of positives flagged in the [virus scans](https://www.chocolatey.org/packages/lsasecretsview/1.25#virus) for this package.  While these are *extremely likely* to be due to the nature of the software (access/view protected storage used by the Local Security Authority) you should make your own decision on this before installing the software.  The issue has been discussed by the software author Nir Sofer a number of times:
